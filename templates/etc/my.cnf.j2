# The MariaDB configuration file
#
# The MariaDB/MySQL tools read configuration files in the following order:
# 1. "{{ mariadb_config_dir }}/my.cnf" (this file) to set global defaults,
# 4. "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
#
# If the same option is defined multiple times, the last one will apply.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.

#
# This group is read both by the client and the server
# use it for options that affect everything
#
[client-server]

# Import all .cnf files from configuration directory
